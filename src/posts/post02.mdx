projectSynopsis: 'When I think of what it means to be patient in tribulation, to be constant in prayer, and to find joy in our hope that lies ahead, I think of one person who embodies that triad of virtues more than almost anyone else in history. I'm talking about the most famous patient man of all timeâ€”Job. If ever a man was called upon to hang on to his faith and his devotion to God in the midst of travail, it was Job.'
