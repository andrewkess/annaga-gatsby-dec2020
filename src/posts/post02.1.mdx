projectSynopsis: 'In the Bible, structure is very significantly related to meaning. Where you miss the structure, you’re going to miss some of the meaning. This is not to say that the Psalms aren’t a great blessing if you don’t know all these things. The Psalms are always a blessing, even when read in the most cursory way. But if you’re going to preach them, you have an obligation to study them carefully, and that’s the place to start.'
